### 1. __$${\color{green}Introduction}$$__
#### - $${\color{blue}Objective}$$:
 _Describe the main goal of the dashboard. For example, is it designed to monitor healthcare performance, patient metrics, resource utilization, or financial data._
#### - $${\color{blue}Users}$$:
_Identify the primary audience, such as healthcare administrators, clinical staff, or policymakers_.
#### -  $${\color{blue}Purpose}$$:                        
_Highlight what decisions the dashboard supports (e.g., optimizing hospital efficiency, reducing patient wait times, or monitoring health outcomes)_.
### 2. $${\color{Green}Data \space Source}$$:                                     
#### - $${\color{blue}Origin\space of\space Data}$$: 
 _List the systems or databases integrated into the dashboard, such as:_
 
- _Electronic Health Records (EHR),_

- _Patient Management Systems,_

- _Financial data (billing, revenue),_

- _External public health datasets_.
 #### - $${\color{blue}Data\space Connection}$$:
  _Specify whether the sources are live (real-time) or static._
  #### - $${\color{blue}Transformation\space Steps}$$:
   _Explain any preprocessing done in Power Query, such as merging, filtering, or cleaning._
 ### 3. $${\color{Green}KPIs \space and\space Metrics}$$:
 #### - $${\color{blue}Key\space Indicators}$$: 
- _Patient-related KPIs: Admission rate, discharge rate, length of stay._

- _Operational KPIs: Bed occupancy, resource allocation, staff-to-patient ratio._

- _Financial KPIs: Cost per patient, revenue per procedure, outstanding payments._
 #### - $${\color{blue}Calculation\space Logic}$$:
 - _Detail how KPIs are derived, including any measures or calculated columns used in the dataset._
### 4. $${\color{Green}Visualizations}$$: 
Purpose of Each Visual:    
- _Charts: Line charts for trends, bar charts for comparisons, pie charts for distribution._

- _Tables: Summarized data views with important metrics._
- _Maps: Geographic representation of patient data or resource allocation._
 #### - $${\color{blue}Purpose\space of\space each\space visual}$$:                                                       
- _For instance, a heatmap might show high-congestion areas in a hospital or regions with high patient inflow._
### 5. $${\color{Green}Filters\space and\space Interactivity}$$: 
 #### - $${\color{blue}Filters}$$:
 - _Slicers for date, department, or patient demographics (age, gender, diagnosis)._
 - _Filters for specific metrics like procedures performed or payment status._
#### - $${\color{blue}Interactivity}$$:
  - _Highlighting: Clicking a segment in a pie chart filters related visuals._
 - _Drill-throughs: Navigating from a summary to detailed views (e.g., from total admissions to individual patient details)._
  - _Tooltips: Hovering over a data point provides additional context._Dashboard Design and Theme
### 6. $${\color{Green}Dashboard\space Design\space and\space Theme}$$:
#### - $${\color{blue}Colour\space Scheme}$$:
- _Colors for critical values (e.g., red for high-risk metrics, green for optimal metrics)._
#### - $${\color{blue}Layout}$$:
- _Logical grouping of visuals (e.g., operational metrics on one side, financial metrics on another)._
#### - $${\color{blue}Accessibility}$$:
- _Font sizes, contrast, and alignment for clear readability._
#### - $${\color{blue}Consistency}$$:
- _Uniform style across visuals (e.g., consistent chart types and labeling)._
### 7. $${\color{Green}Insights\space Provided}$$:
#### - $${\color{blue}Operational\space Insights }$$:                                                       
- _Highlight trends in patient volume, efficiency metrics, or staffing needs._
#### - $${\color{blue}Financial\space Insights }$$:   
- _Identify areas of cost savings, revenue growth, or overdue payments._
#### - $${\color{blue}Predictive\space Insights:}$$:   
- _Any forecasts or trend analysis presented in the dashboard._
#### - $${\color{blue}Recommendations}$$:   
- _Actions or strategies suggested based on the data (e.g., reallocating resources to high-demand areas)._
